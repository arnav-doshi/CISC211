What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (1 mark)

The first part of the lab was relatively straightforward, with generating the even numbers up to 20. A challenge I had in the second part of the lab was keeping up with the many variables. Up till now, we've only dealt with up to 4 variables, but dealing with 5, while comparing them, gave me a little bit more to think about.
