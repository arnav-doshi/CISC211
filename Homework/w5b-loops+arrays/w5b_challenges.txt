What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)?

One of the biggest challenges in performing the lab was converting my knowledge from other programming languages to assembly. For the fibonacci task, in other language, I would make a recursive function with memoization, but in assembly, it's not as straightforward. Task #3 also had the challenge of keeping track of what number you're at in the array.
